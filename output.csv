"And what's the other half? Veg?","Vegetarian pizza?"
"Yeah, vegetarian.","Got it. Do you need any changes to the toppings of either the [ITEM_NAME] or vegetarian?"
"So that's where I was coming. So basically with the margherita, very little tomato sauce. It's for a child and she doesn't like too much of it. So both very less sauce on the bread and on top of the cheese as well, like, very less. And if you don't put anything on the cheese, that would be even better.","Understood. So less tomato sauce altogether is better for the [ITEM_NAME] side?"
"Yes, just a very little. That's about it. So like half a spoon and spread it around. That's about it. I get it all the time from you guys. Just a half a spoon and spread it around. And on the veg side, if you can make it spicy, if you got any jalapeno or something would be good.","I can do that. Less tomato sauce on the [ITEM_NAME] and add jalapenos to the vegetarian to make it spicy. Would you like to add chili flakes as well?"
"Yes, please.","That's added. Anything else you'd like to order?"

Half southwest chicken and half [ITEM_NAME]. All good."
"Yes. That's cool.","Wonderful. So that's meant to be 41.50, but since we added [ITEM_INGREDIENT] to the [ITEM_NAME] pizza, there's an extra charge for that. So it's 42.50. All right."
"Okay. Yes, that's fine.","Thank you. No problem. Any garlic bread or any desserts or drinks?"

And since I've been in [LOCATION] we've been ordering them from [LOCATION] for over ten years. And they're actually in the worst state I've ever seen. It looks like the pizza boxes have been shaken and turned upside down. Half the pizzas were stuck to the top of it. The toppings are all over the place. Like they're actually horrendous. When he's pulled them out to pass them to me. He's pulled them out sideways.","I'm very sorry to hear about the state of your pizzas. Can I confirm the name on the order, please?"

"Is it all right if I get it delivered?","Deliveries at the moment are 80 minutes. And the problem is, like, we close at nine, so I don't mind taking the order. It's up to you. If you want to wait, pick up is only 20 minutes."

"[PHONE_NUMBER]","[PHONE_NUMBER] [PHONE_NUMBER]."
"Sorry.","[PHONE_NUMBER] or [PHONE_NUMBER]. Thank you. Is that for [PERSON_NAME] on?"
"Yeah.","Thank you. What would you like?"
"One gluten free pizza, half southwest chicken with no onion.","Okay."

"It was for [PERSON_NAME].","So was it a [ITEM_SIZE] vegetarian and [ITEM_SIZE] half barbecue, half mixed pizza?"
"Correct. Yeah.","So what were you wanting to talk to me about?"
"So the vegetarian pizza was meant to come with sauce on it, but there was no sauce on it when I came home and had a look at it, which isn't really so much of an issue. It was a fair bit overcooked and there was not nearly as much topping on it as there usually is. Now, if there was some kind of way we can ameliorate that.","Yeah. Just one moment. I'll go speak with my boss. Thank you."
"Yes, no worries.","Hi. So I just spoke to my manager and they said that. Were you wanting us to remake it?"

"Look, I've just been transferred through to you guys. We've been ordering town of country for a long time. And since I've been in [LOCATION] we've been ordering them from [LOCATION] for over ten years. And they're actually the worst state I've ever seen. It looks like the pizza boxes have been shaken and turned upside down. Half the pizzas were stuck to the top of it. The toppings are all over the place like they're actually horrendous. When he's pulled them out to pass them to me, he's pulled them out sideways.","Yes. Sorry. What did the driver look like?"
"He was a short young Indian fella.","Yes. Sorry, what was the name of your order?"
"The name? Was it under your name? It was under [PERSON_NAME]. It was four now. [PERSON_NAME]. [LOCATION] [PERSON_NAME].","Was it?"

"Exactly. And it's just a must.","Yeah. I'll just be right back. I'll just be 1 second. I'm sorry. I think cold and stuffed up. Another pizza again. [PERSON_NAME], pin. One of the other pizzas is in bad shape as well. And it's not [PERSON_NAME]. [LOCATION]. Print the ticket out. Tell them you send it away. Yeah. Hi. We can make those both for you again and send them as soon as possible. It shouldn't be as long as you waited last time."
"No look, we've just waited an hour and a half. We're certainly not waiting for pizzas again. Obviously. We just wanted you guys to know that this is. In ten years this is the worst I've ever seen a pizza in my life.","Yeah, I understand. It's absolutely not acceptable. And we will be speaking to the driver. I'm pretty sure I know which one that one is. So. I'm so sorry about that. Is there anything we could do for you?"
"Well look, we would probably appreciate after so long service a credit in the future which would probably be acceptable.","Yeah, I'll speak to my boss about that. I'll just be 1 second. Sorry."
"Yeah. [PERSON_NAME], put your light on.","Yes, whatever. The visa. Voucher for the visa. That one was all right. When are we going to get. Are we going to deliver the voucher? Hi.

"All right, no worries.","We'll get that fixed."
"Yeah, look. Definitely. Look, I would suggest that the fellow that dropped him off either needs to be trained or let go because he was terrible.","I totally agree with that. We're so sorry. We'll issue the voucher and we wish you a lovely night. Sorry."
"Thank you. [PERSON_NAME].","That's correct."

"Yeah, good [PERSON_NAME], how are you?","I'm good, thanks. I did read your email about the complaint for the large half [ITEM_NAME], half [PERSON_NAME] family. I'm really sorry but I know why this has been happening with you in the past few times as well. So on our online thing, there's an option to choose [ITEM_INGREDIENT] on top or just [ITEM_INGREDIENT] because the [ITEM_NAME] comes with just [ITEM_INGREDIENT] on base. So what the pizza makers have been thinking is you say extra [ITEM_INGREDIENT] so they just put extra [ITEM_INGREDIENT] on base. Well, this is wrong on our side also it should be just one thing like just [ITEM_INGREDIENT] on top or something. But I'm really sorry about it but I was just asking the guys why have you been making this mistake from past so many times? So when they read that, he goes like oh, it says [ITEM_INGREDIENT], just extra [ITEM_INGREDIENT]. So we thought it's just extra [ITEM_INGREDIENT] on base. I'm like well I'll make a pizza for you now. If you want I can deliver it to you straight away. And we'll also credit you this pizza because of the past mistakes we have been making for you."
"Thank you for that. But we actually probably don't need another pizza right now though.","Okay, that's okay. I'll issue you the voucher. So we'll have credit to the voucher the same amount for what you have spent and you can get a free pizza next time for the next three months whenever you want to order. But I'm really sorry but I just wanted to talk to you to tell you why this has been happening and why has it been that consistent on your pizza?"
"Yeah.","Cool. Thank you. We'll also change it online but if it's not changed, just make sure you put the [ITEM_INGREDIENT] on top rather than just selecting the [ITEM_INGREDIENT] is okay."
"Thank you for that.","Thank you so much for understanding."
"No worries mate.","Thank you. Have a good day."
"What's the.","Okay. She's got a main [ITEM_NAME], El Crema with added [ITEM_INGREDIENT]. Yes. And she's got a [ITEM_SIZE] barbecue pizza on a thick base. Yes."

"Actually, can I have extra chicken on the chicken pizza, please?","Okay. You want extra [ITEM_INGREDIENT] on the barbecue half?"

"No. So then you've got two. Lots of two for the special, is it?","Yes."
"How does it work there?","Yes. So it's $92 altogether. It should be about 41 50 for one of them because you've added extra [ITEM_INGREDIENT]. It should be 43 50 for the other one and then the garlic."
"$20 for a [ITEM_NAME]. Is that $20 for a [ITEM_NAME]?","No, it goes into a deal for two [ITEM_SIZE] pizzas for 41 50."
"But is it cheaper just to get a [ITEM_NAME]? Because it came to 72 50 before.","It's $23 for one [ITEM_NAME]. But if you get it in the two [ITEM_SIZE] pizza deals, it's 41 50."

"Yeah.","I'll just be right back. One moment."
"Yeah, he left and he said he would come back. I'm not sure what's happening. If he's gone back to you guys or maybe. Yeah, I'm not sure of his name. He had dark hair.","Dark hair, was he?"
"Yeah, I think he was Chinese.","Yes. Okay, well, do you want me to check when he gets here to see if he's going to bring those over?"
"Surely he'd be back by now. That was nearly half an hour ago.","I'll just be right back. One moment. Sorry."
"Bring two actual waters, not mineral waters.","And apparently he's going to come back with them."
"Oh, did he look. What's this?","Hi. So when he took your delivery, he might have gone to another house as well. So he might have taken his time, but he should be back soon, and then he'll bring those straight to you."
"So he's going back to you guys.","Then back to me, if that's okay with you."
"Yeah, I sort of did want to, obviously have the drinks with the food, hence why I ordered them. So the food has been here for almost half an hour, so it's almost cold to be having it with the drinks, if you know what I mean.","Yeah. Did you want a different solution? I'm not really sure. Sorry."
"Yeah, I'm not sure what you guys can do. Are you the manager there?","I can go talk to him again."
"Yeah. Okay. Just because we've got our pizza. But, yeah, by the time he brings the drinks, that'll be if he's gone to another house. Like he should have finished what he'd done here, you know what I mean? Since it was obviously our fault, we ordered the right drinks, and then we're sitting here waiting for him to drop off other deliveries.","So what would you like me to check we can do for you? Like I can check with my manager. What would you like me to ask?"
"Just what does he think that's appropriate? His business. So see what he would think was appropriate that the customer has been dropped off the wrong drinks and then waiting.","Now, the driver just got back. If you were happy, if he just bring them to you straight away. I just see him come through the door and our boss is talking to him."
"Yeah, so he'll still be like another 15-20 minutes back to [LOCATION]. So it's almost 45 minutes. Can I speak to your manager?","Yeah, I'll just be right back. I'll see if he's busy or not. I'll take. Hi, [PERSON_NAME]. Sorry again. My boss is a bit busy at the moment because the kitchen is a bit hectic. But he can call you back later tonight when it's quieter to speak about it. But the driver will be on his way as soon as he can and get those to you, if that's okay."
"Yes. So am I still paying for it then?","I'd say so. Unless when I tell the manager to call you later when he's free, he might be able to speak to you about that."
"Yeah, but do I pay the driver or not?","So you've already paid for the order, right?"
"Yeah, no, I haven't paid for it yet because he was supposed to come back and bring the drinks straight away. I didn't think it was his dropping off other orders and doing.","You say you haven't paid for it?"
"No.","I'd say just pay for them, but then we can call our manager after."
"Well, there's probably. Yeah, if your manager is busy, tell the guy not to worry about bringing the drinks. I won't give him the money yet until I sort it out with your manager. The manager can just give me a call when I'm pretty sure. Got five minutes to talk to an unhappy customer?","Yeah. So did you not want the drinks to be taken to you?"
"No, there's no point. It's nearly 45 minutes later. So, yeah, I'd rather just sort it out with your manager first and see what he's actually going to do about it rather than pay for everything that's not really been up to scratch, you know what I mean? Like, I'd like to speak to him first and see what he wants to do in regards to it all.","Yeah, so we won't send the drinks with you. And do you mind if I just take your phone number and when he's ready. So what was your phone number? Sorry?"
"[PHONE_NUMBER] [PHONE_NUMBER] [PHONE_NUMBER].","Yes. [PHONE_NUMBER] [PHONE_NUMBER] [PHONE_NUMBER]. And just so when he's free, as soon as possible, I'll get him to ring you about that."
"Yeah. Okay. So they're not obviously bringing the drinks. I'll just wait for his call.","Yeah. Okay."
"All right. Thank you.","Sorry. Bye. That's okay."
"Yeah. [PHONE_NUMBER], [PHONE_NUMBER], [PHONE_NUMBER].","Yeah. [PHONE_NUMBER]. [PHONE_NUMBER] okay, so I'll read it back to you. That is [PHONE_NUMBER] yeah. Okay, wonderful. Let's have a look. Is that for [PERSON_NAME]? [LOCATION] [LOCATION], [LOCATION] [LOCATION]."

So you mean you have your own payment system, you have your own online ordering website and everything?"

"Not this time.","Not this time. So you prefer to get a [ITEM_SIZE] pizza, but that will be. Well, that should still be fine because you have $30 for the basic price and then you have $5 for the delivery. So total comes down to $34, madam."

"No. So then you've got two. Lots of two for the special, is it?","Yes. So it's $92 altogether. It should be $41.50 for one of them because you've added extra [ITEM_INGREDIENT]. It should be $43.50 for the other one and then the garlic bread."
"Is that $20 for a [ITEM_NAME]?","No, it goes into a deal for two [ITEM_SIZE] pizzas for $41.50."
"But is it cheaper just to get a [ITEM_NAME]? Because it came to $72.50 before.","It's $23 for one [ITEM_NAME] by itself. But if you get it in the two [ITEM_SIZE] pizza deal, it's $41.50."
"How much did you say for one [ITEM_NAME]?","Just for a [ITEM_NAME], it's $23 by itself."
"Does that make sense?","Yes, all right, so your total is $92. Is that the cheapest deal that we've got for the four?"

"Yeah.","Yes. So what were you wanting to talk to me about?"
"So the vegetarian pizza was meant to come with sauce on it, but there was no sauce on it when I came home and had a look at it, which isn't really so much of an issue. It was a fair bit overcooked and there was not nearly as much topping on it as there usually is.","I'm sorry to hear that. Were you wanting us to remake it?"
"Just 1 second. The person I bought the pizza for said no.","Would you like us to issue you a voucher for next time?"

"Yes. We've ordered with you quite a few times, and they just seem to be a lot smaller than usual.","All right. What I'll do is I will transfer your call to management and hopefully they can rectify the matter. Thank you."
"Hi, turning [PERSON_NAME], [PERSON_NAME] speaking. Hi, [PERSON_NAME], my name is [PERSON_NAME]. I just recently received my pizzas from delivery and they're supposed to be large, but I don't think they're large because they're not as big as what they usually are.","Weird question, but how many slices are there?"
"I believe they're supposed to be eight, but I think there's two less than that.","Give me 2 seconds and I'll just speak to someone in the kitchen that made your pizza. Give me 2 seconds. Sorry."
"Hi, so I've just been asked, were the pizzas correct that you ordered? So the barbecue chicken and the country special?","Yes, the flavors were the correct ones."
"So the barbecue chicken had pineapple and salami on it?","Yes, those are the [ITEM_SIZE] pizzas. That's the [ITEM_SIZE]."
"So I've just been told that one of my coworkers cut it. So they reckon it was a [ITEM_SIZE] pizza that they cut.","Okay. We order with you quite regularly, and these pizzas are rather small compared to what they usually are. Has there been a size change from what is [ITEM_SIZE]?"
"Give me 2 seconds. He orders quite regularly and I'm 100%.","Sure it's a [ITEM_SIZE] pizza. We'll just tell him we'll make it again. We'll bring it, but we'll have to check those pizzas."
"I'm 100% sure, but, so we can make those pizzas again for you and send them out, but we'll just have to receive both of the pizzas back from you just to make sure that they're the wrong size.","Okay. Yeah, so we'll just make the barbecue chicken and the country special again for you and. Yeah, just when the driver gets there. Is it possible if you could send a photo as well?"
"How to send a photo? How to send a photo just through message?","Yes, I'll just give the number."
"So I'll just give you my manager's phone number and just message that to him. So his phone number. Do you have a pen there?","I don't. The reception here is not that great, so I might not be able to send a photo."
"I'll just give you his phone number anyways, just so we can sort that out. Yeah. I don't have a pen and paper on me. I'm actually outside of my house because the reception inside is not very good.","Doesn't have good reception."
"I'm, like, 200% sure those are too large.","So. Yeah, don't worry about that. We'll just make them again and just give us back the two pizzas that were the wrong size. Okay, thank you."
"Pickup.","Pickup. Yeah, I'll be happy to do that. Can you provide me your phone number please, sir, if you don't mind."
"Is this for town and country? Pizza.","Town and Country. Yes indeed."
"It's [PHONE_NUMBER] yeah, that's it.","Okay, thank you. Is that for [PERSON_NAME]?"
"Yes.","Welcome [PERSON_NAME]. Let's begin. What's the item you would like to order?"

"That'll be it.","Okay, that's fine. That is ordered. That's $19 and you should be able to pick it up in about 20 minutes. Okay."
"[PERSON_NAME] [PERSON_NAME].","Let me have a look. I'm so sorry. That's fine. Yes, that's on a pickup. Did you want to make that into a delivery?"
"Yes, please.","Okay, one second. Let me try and get you connected to the front desk. If that doesn't work out, I'll do that myself. But let me just have a look first."
"Thank you. I'm so sorry.","No, that's fine. It's all good. I'm going to go ahead and transfer you now."
"Hi, I accidentally did pick up instead of delivery on my order.","Yeah, what was the name for the order?"
"[PERSON_NAME] [PERSON_NAME]. And you wanted a delivery, is that right?","Yes, please. I'm so sorry."
"That's all right. Mistakes happen. Could I just grab your address, please?","Yes. [LOCATION] [LOCATION], [LOCATION] [LOCATION], [LOCATION]."
"So, [LOCATION] [LOCATION], [LOCATION] [LOCATION]. [LOCATION].","Yes, that's it."
"That one's going to be about a 60 minutes delivery. Is that okay?","Yeah, that's fine. I'm the one that made the mistake, so that's all good. I'm happy to have cold pizza. It's all good."
"No worries. So that one's just going to be a $5 delivery fee. Were you wanting to pay cash on delivery or just now?","I can pay on card now, if that's okay."
"Card now? Yeah. So what was your card number?","Sorry? [CREDIT_CARD_NUMBER]."
"[CREDIT_CARD_NUMBER].","Yes."
"[CREDIT_CARD_NUMBER].","Yes."

The card number being [CREDIT_CARD_NUMBER] and the expiry [CREDIT_CARD_EXPIRATION]. And the CVV [CREDIT_CARD_CVV] [CREDIT_CARD_CVV] [CREDIT_CARD_CVV]? Yes, that's correct."
"Yeah, no worries. I was just loading it. Might take a second. It's all good.","No worries. That one's gone through. Should be about an hour."
"I said, can I have your phone number?","Could you please provide your phone number?"
"[PHONE_NUMBER].","Okay."
"[PHONE_NUMBER] too.","All right, just a sec."
"Is it for [PERSON_NAME]?","Yes, [PERSON_NAME] is correct."

"Yes.","With cheese on top. Would you like just no pineapple on half of it?"
"Yes.","Okay. Anything else?"
"That's all, thanks.","Thank you. Let me just add the garlic bread. So you've got a [ITEM_SIZE] Mexicana, a [ITEM_SIZE] Capricciosa. A main penne, a chicken pesto.

"Yes.","Okay. Just so that you know, there's no [ITEM_INGREDIENT] on barbecue chicken pizza anyway, isn't it?"
"What's the other one? I like the wrong one for you.","I think it could be the meat lovers pizza. Because that contains [ITEM_INGREDIENT] in it."
"No, it's not meat lovers.","I'll read the ingredients to you. So it's tomato sauce, barbecue chicken, cheese, and again. And barbecue sauce on top."
"It's the barbecue pizza with no onion. It has onion in it?","Yeah. Is that the one you want or you want the chicken barbecue pizza?"
"Barbecue pizza. Sorry. With no onion.","Okay, that's fine. A [ITEM_SIZE] barbecue pizza with no [ITEM_INGREDIENT]. Got it. What else would you like?"

"Thank you. Hi, town and country. [PERSON_NAME] speaking.","Hi, [PERSON_NAME], it's [PERSON_NAME] from Pienza Way. We just ordered three pizzas, and I asked, when I ordered them, did the pizzas come with cheese on top? And I was assured that they do. And I've got two [ITEM_NAME] here that have got no cheese on."
"Yeah. So I think whoever took your order didn't realize that the [ITEM_NAME], they don't have cheese on top.","Yeah, but that's why I asked."
"Yeah.","Give me seconds."
"Yeah.","So I need to stipulate that I want cheese on top. Is that right?"
"Yeah, you do. Because the [ITEM_NAME], there's a few pizzas that we make that don't have cheese on top. So the [ITEM_NAME], the country specials, they don't have cheese on top. They just have cheese on the base. Yeah. I'm so sorry that they told you that because we don't have cheese topped that one. So. I'm so sorry.","All right, well, nothing can do about it now. Let's remember us for the next time."

"Yes, just give me a minute. Can you repeat your phone number, please, so I make sure that he has got the right number.","We have got the wrong number on the system.
